        "**1.** Explain the purpose and advantages of NumPy in scientific computing and data analysis. How does it enhance Python's capabilities for numerical operations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 1: NumPy provides efficient, multidimensional array objects and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It enhances Python's capabilities by offering fast computations, easy-to-use mathematical operations, and support for large datasets, significantly improving performance over standard Python lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2**. Compare and contrast np.mean() and np.average() functions in NumPy. When would you use one over the other?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 2: np.mean() calculates the arithmetic mean of array elements, while np.average() allows for weighted averages by specifying a weights array. Use np.mean() for simple averages and np.average() when you need to account for different weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3**. Describe the methods for reversing a NumPy array along different axes. Provide examples for 1D and 2D arrays.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer 4: Use the .dtype attribute of a NumPy array to determine its data type. Data types are crucial for memory efficiency and computational speed, as they define the size and precision of the data elements.\n",

        "***5.*** Define ndarrays in NumPy and explain their key features. How do they differ from standard Python lists?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 5: ndarray is the core data structure in NumPy, representing N-dimensional arrays. Key features include support for vectorized operations, fixed-size elements, and broadcasting. Unlike Python lists, ndarrays offer efficient storage and operations for large datasets.\n",

        "**6**. Analyze the performance benefits of NumPy arrays over Python lists for large-scale numerical operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 6: NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists due to their fixed-size elements and contiguous memory allocation. They enable vectorized operations, reducing execution time compared to iterative operations on lists.\n",
